# Metrics

### Web application which allows users to create multiple metric and post values to that metric

## Project Description
Web API supports the following actions:
* Create a Metric - Time complexity O(1)
* Post Values to a Metric - Time complexity O(1)
* Retrieve Statistics including:
  - Arithmetic Mean of a values posted to metric - Time complexity O(1)
  - Median of a values posted to metric - Time complexity O(1)
  - Min value for metric - Time complexity O(1)
  - Max value for metric - Time complexity O(1)

## Technology
All API features are O(1) time complexity. It is also O(1) space complexity.
### O(1) time complexity
The input value are sorted indirectly using min-heap, max-heap, median-heap(made of half min-heap and half max-heap)
### O(1) space complexity
The data struction of the 'Neo' metric looks like this.
```
{ Neo:
{ name: 'Neo',
  sum: 67,
  content: 
   { '0': { value: 12 },
     '1': { value: 20 },
     '2': { value: 25 },
     '3': { value: 10 } },
  autoGeneratedKey: 3,
  minHalfHeap: { content: [ 1, 2 ], compareFunction: [Function] },
  maxHalfHeap: { content: [ 0, 3 ], compareFunction: [Function] },
  minHeap: { content: [ 3, 0, 2, 1 ], compareFunction: [Function] },
  maxHeap: { content: [ 2, 0, 1, 3 ], compareFunction: [Function] } },
  ...
  }
```
The sorting heap only save a copy of the index for conent. It takes the contents as arguement when it performs the soring. For scalability, the value can be very big, it saves space by only copying the index only.
